# Exercise prep

* `git clone https://github.com/MCR-Digital/apprentice-bootcamp-fundamentals-3`
* Make sure the tests pass in your language
  * Java folk: import the `exercises/java` directory using ‘Import project from external model’
  * Choose ‘Use default gradle wrapper (recommended)’

# Code Smells

---

> A code smell is a hint that something has gone wrong somewhere in your code. Use the smell to track down the problem.  
>   
> Note that a CodeSmell is a hint that something might be wrong, not a certainty.

### Why ‘smell’?

+ Things can smell ‘off’ without knowing why: ‘the sniff test’
+ Your sense of smell will improve

Notes: Everyone has a sense of smell  
  Can become more refined  
  Can’t always tell what something is  
  Can usually tell if it smells good or bad  

---

No single definitive list of smells

Notes: Conventions have appeared over the years

## Codebase

Refactoring codebase called ‘Trivia’

Notes: Used in ‘Legacy Code Retreat’ workshops

Notes: Going to be using QWAN Refactoring Cards

### Two types of card

+ Smell cards: help you identify the smell and suggest solutions
+ Refactor cards: explain what the suggested refactors achieve

# Ideas

Lines of code in GitHub?
Reading code versus writing code
QWAN cards - recognise smells - fix smells?
What is legacy code, is it a pejorative term?
The existing code is quite good, said no developer ever.
Which idiot wrote this? - git blame
Clever is a circular scale.

Run Sonar or equivalent on code-base - compare results with manual review - judgement. GitHub integrate?
Static analysis for:
* style
* bugs
* security
* performance
* coverage

Code never breaks - "HYPERAWARE EDITING"

The importance of testing - getting code under test
