# Ideas

- Lines of code in GitHub?
- Reading code versus writing code
- QWAN cards - recognise smells - fix smells?
- What is legacy code, is it a pejorative term?
- The existing code is quite good, said no developer ever.
- Which idiot wrote this? - git blame
- Clever is a circular scale.
- Coverage? Get them to consider coverage with just the golden master.

- Run Sonar or equivalent on code-base - compare results with manual review - judgement. GitHub integrate?
- Static analysis for:
    * style
    * bugs
    * security
    * performance
    * coverage

- Code never breaks - "HYPERAWARE EDITING"

- The importance of testing - getting code under test
