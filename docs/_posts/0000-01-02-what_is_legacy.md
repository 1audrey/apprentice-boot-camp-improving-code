# What is "legacy" code?

Note:
Ask the audience?
We intentionally haven't used the word legacy in the title of this bootcamp - because it is so loaded.

---

## A pejorative term

+ Old
+ Dirty
+ Hard to work with

Note:
These are all common perceptions - and perhaps what the audience will have suggested.

---

## Where does it come from?

+ We write it
+ Anything that's existing
+ The code you wrote before lunch

Note:
Expect the audience to suggest it comes from elsewhere.
Emphasise our role in creating it.

---

> The existing code is quite good.

\- _No Developer Ever_

Note:
All pre-existing code is typically regarded as poor quality.

---

> Which idiot wrote this?

+ `git blame Legacy.java`

Note:
Use of term idiot is intentional to indicate the strength of feeling around these issues.
Talk about appropriate language?
Mention `git blame` and the use of version control for auditing.

Note:
The emphasis here is not to be so quick to judge - we are often the culprit.

## Clever is a circular scale


Note:
We do the wrong thing even with the best of intentions.

## Embrace the legacy

Note:
We need to take ownership of legacy code and help ensure we don't leave behind a _Big Ball of Mud_ for those who follow.
